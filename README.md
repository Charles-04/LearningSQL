### This a learning project where I created a chat-like database imitating what I thought whatsapp would look like
## Contents
+ ### The database consists of a script to generate four tables as follows :
  + The Chat Table
  + The Message Table
  + The Users Table
  + The Groups Table
+ ### The project also has images of views and database diagrams
  + The view : This view was created to query for the sender, timestamp and message sent
  + The ERD : This shows the relationship between the different tables in the database
